Hello, SMP team members. I want to play a game.

For years, your team has thrived. You have served as a vessel to help transfer DOC to a modern era. A task which you have completed well. Some say this newfound success is well-deserved. Today, we put that to the test.

As we speak, a poisonous gas is being emitted into each of the rooms in which you reside. In order to survive, you must work together to solve a series of puzzles. If you succeed before time runs out, the game is won.

Normally, I'd have you physically together to do this, but we've had to make some changes due to COVID-19. What a year, huh? Please, wear a mask. Thank you.

Best of luck to you all. Let the game begin.
