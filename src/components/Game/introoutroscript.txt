Intro Script:

"Hello, SMP members. I want to play a game.

For years, your department has thrived. Each of you has worked tirelessly to ensure that customers are provided with the best possible product.
Your department  has served as the perfect vessel to transfer DOC into the modern era. The company's golden children. You should be proud of yourselves.

Some say this newfound success is well-deserved. I call it a fluke. Today, we put your skills to the test.

As we speak, a poisonous gas is being emitted into each of the rooms in which you reside. The game is simple. Work together to answer a series of riddles before time runs out, and you survive.

Normally, I'd have gathered you together physically to do this, but we've had to make some changes due to COVID-19. What can I say? These are unprecendented times. Wear a mask.

Best of luck to you all. Let the game begin."



Outro Script:

"Congratulations...

I gotta be honest. I reallllly wasn't expecting that. So uh.. let's call a truce? I let you free and you don't go to the authorities? Sound good? Awesome. I'll uh... see you later, I guess.

Thanks for playing."
